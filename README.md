Documentation for the brigade and related initiatives.

This repository contains documentation for management of all C4GNV projects
collectively. Currently, this documentation and process are managed by
@ajcrites and @gotoplanb

The task board for managing the high level tasks for all
C4GNV projects as well as meta tasks is https://github.com/orgs/c4gnv/projects/1

## Organization meta requirements
The C4GNV meta team works with individual project teams to create requirements
and ensure that projects have what they need to achieve their goals. This
includes a list of tasks that need to be done as part of project setup and
ongoing work.

Additionally any tools or software that is required to optimize the management
of other C4GNV projects will be handled as part of the meta team project.

When starting a new project, meta facilitators should work with team leaders to
make sure that setup tasks are met within a given timeline. They should also
perform ongoing work to make sure that ongoing tasks are performed and do
whatever is necessary to ensure that projects continue to move forward.

### Setup Tasks
0. Work with project teams to create roles and assign a team lead as needed.
1. Help the team lead perform setup tasks, especially project planning
 and scheduling.

### Ongoing Tasks
0. Follow up with team leads to make sure any ongoing tasks are being fulfilled
 in an appropriate and timely manner.
 * Reassign leadership of projects in cases where a team leader can no longer
  fulfill their duties.
1. Work with teams to keep projects moving forward -- especially work with
 newcomers to make sure they are able to contribute to projects.
2. Continually update meta requirements for the organization and project to
 fulfill the goals of C4GNV.

## Project meta requirements
Each C4GNV project is different and will be managed differently. Regardless,
there are certain tasks and ongoing requirements that each project requires.

Each project has a project lead who is in charge of the meta requirements for
the project. Our hope is that by fulfilling these tasks, the project will
remain organized, continue moving forward, and be welcoming to new volunteers.

### Setup Tasks
0. Outline goals for the project. We should have an idea of what we want to
 achieve and by when.
1. Create a project backlog. Generally, this can be managed via Github project.
 The project backlog will include technical tasks, non-technical tasks, and
 meta tasks (building the backlog is itself a task). The idea is not to build a
 complete backlog for the entire project, but to have enough tasks laid out to
 remain productive.
2. Define roles for the project team. We expect project teams to change pretty
 frequently as peoples' availability changes, but teams should have defined
 roles such that individuals have a clear path to what they need to achieve.
 * We realize and accept there may be a limited number of roles for a project.
  We want to welcome everyone to C4GNV, but individual projects may have a
  capacity limit. This should be lined out with the team roles.
3. Create a working schedule for the team. Team leads should work with the team
 to create a schedule for work. This can be whatever works for the team, but it
 should provide some consistency for working time.
4. Create a schedule for completion of tasks (e.g. sprints) to keep the
 project moving forward in a regular fashion.
5. Document any onboarding required to get started with the project including
 installation and testing instructions and general guidance.

### Ongoing Tasks
1. Maintain the project backlog. New tasks should be created as needed.
2. Assign project tasks to individuals. Leads should work with the team to
 make sure that each role has at least one task assigned to them.
3. Ensure that tasks move forward according to a defined schedule (see above)
